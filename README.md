# Fork of dead library JFoenix
This is a fork of the now dead repo JFoenix that is meant to extend a little compatibility to newer versions of Java and JavaFX.
The module declaration has been removed as it was actually working, no guarantee that it'll be added back as it may require much work. This project is focused towards the needs of [SCS2 Project](https://github.com/ihmcrobotics/simulation-construction-set-2).

# Build
The build has been changed to using the0[ IHMC Gradle Build system](https://github.com/ihmcrobotics/ihmc-build).

# Demo
For detailed steps on getting the demo running, see [the wiki].
